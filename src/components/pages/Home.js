      Hello! I am Shae, a 22-year-old student studying law at QUT and completing University of Adelaide coding bootcamp. I am hoping to one day work as in-house counsel within the tech sector. I wanted to learn more about tech and coding, whilst also creating an opportunity for me to work within the sector whilst completing my studies. So, I chose to dive head first into the bootcamp with no prior knowledge and just hoping for the best.  In my spare time I like to hang out with my dog, go for coffee walks with friends or tend to my many house plants! üê∂‚òïüå±
